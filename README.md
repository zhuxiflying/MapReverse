MapReverse is a project prototype built by Xi Zhu and Anthony Robinson at the GeoVISTA Center in the Department of Geography at Penn State University. MapReverse is designed to help explore maps shared in social media to uncover their potential sources and derivatives. MapReverse combines machine learning services for reverse image search with visualizations to make it possible for users to better understand the characteristics and dissemination of maps in social media.
